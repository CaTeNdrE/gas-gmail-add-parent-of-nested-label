# gas-gmail-add-parent-of-nested-label

Google Apps Script that adds ancestors' labels to Gmail messages labelled with one of their descendants.

The goal of this script is to create a Gmail label search experience more akin to a directory search without having to duplicate and combine filter rules. 

Gmail's custom user labels can be nested below one another and Gmail displays labels in the menu in a way that closely mimics a computer's directory structure. Unlike a search on a computer, when searching a label Gmail does not automatically include its descendants. 

This script was developed because my preferred default approach to searching within labels is to 'include' rather than 'exclude' their descendants.

## Example  
**Ancestor**  
Label located in the same branch as another but at least one level higher up (e.g. parent, grandparent, etc.)  
   
**Descendent**  
Label located in the same branch as another but at least one level lower down (e.g. child, grandchild, etc.)  

In this menu, the label 'eriador' has 4 descendants:  

     ------------
     Sent
     All Mail 
     Spam
     Drafts
     eriador
        > shire
             > westfarthing
        > rivendell
        > breeland
     ------------   

  
**4 Descendants of 'eriador'**  

     3 Children:   'shire' ('eriador-shire'), 'rivendell' ('eriador-rivendell'), and 'breeland' ('eriador-breeland')
     1 Grandchild: 'westfarthing' ('eriador-shire-westfarthing') 
     
**Also note**

     'shire' is an ancestor of 'westfarthing'  
     'westfarthing' is a descendent of both 'shire' and 'eriador'
     

**Search Eriador for Isildur's Bane**  
  
To search for "Isildur's Bane" in 'eriador' including its descendants ('shire', 'westfarthing', 'rivendell', and 'breeland') the Gmail search needs to be a variation of:

     Search:  "Isildur's Bane" label:({eriador eriador-shire eriador-shire-westfarthing eriador-rivendell eriador-breeland})
   
   
### One Label to Bind them All  
Using this script you are able to find Isildur's Bane wherever it is in Eriador using:  

     Search:  "Isildur's Bane" label:eriador  

## Installation  
   
A.  Create a Google Apps Script (GAS) Project

7. Click the Save button.

### C. Add dependency
8. Click on the plus (+) symbol on 'Services  +' to open the 'Add a service' dialog.
9. Type 'Gmail' in the 'Identifier' field.
10. Click 'Add'

### D. Authorize Project

## Feedback
This is my first Google Apps Script as well as my first Git.  This may be reflected in poor and/or odd choices in both spaces. Constructive feedback is welcomed and, of course, please advise of any issues/bugs encountered.
